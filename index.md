# What is NeuroLib?

The Rice Neural Data Library is a archival data storage resource for the big data that modern
systems neuroscience experiments gather. No more must you fear that a power surge will wipe out
years of experiments. We will safely and securely store your data in the cloud while making it
easy to access. What we ask in return is a moderate effort for curation. This facilitates the
second aspect of the NeuroLib, facilitating collaborations between experimental and
computational neuroscientists.

# Who are the NeuroLib team?

The NeuroLib team includes Ashok Veeraraghavan, Jacob Robinson, and Caleb Kemere. We are
supported by the [Ken Kennedy Institute](http://www.k2i.rice.edu/) at Rice University.
